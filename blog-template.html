<!-- Wireframing and creating an HTML page with a pair was pretty easy for this challenge. Since my partner and I wanted a simple layout for the blog post, figuring out the HTML code was not complicated. We knew we needed 3 separated divisions within the body, so we set that up. I am looking forward to inputting CSS and moving around the different divisions to recreate our wireframe design. I did find wireframing helpful to the development process especially for pairing work. Since we designed the wireframe together, we both had the same end image in our heads and were able to collaborate towards it. Wireframing was also a great way to plan out the number of headings and placement of links. My pair and I decided that a good wireframe was simple and included a website layout minus all the details. For instance, on the main blog division, we just wrote Blog Entry here. We could have written all of the details, such as title and date, but we knew that our main focus was the overall layout of the page. My partner knew about divs and introduced the general use of it. I learned that divs section off different parts of the body.
