  <h2>My Impression of DBC Thus Far</h2>
  <h4>August 24, 2015</h4>


    <p>
      <b>What's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The DBC opportunity seems surreal to me, and I feel like going through this chapter of my life will be a humbling experience. I think that DBC makes tremendous efforts to really reach out to the students and to build this supporting network with the mindset ,"We're all in this together." I think it's amazing that DBC gathers people from all places who are taking a pause in different phases of their lives to commit to learning programming. On top of this, the DBC experience allows us to feel comfortable with one another and encourages us to help and learn from each another. Without the "DBC experience," this journey would not be as meaningful to me.

        <b>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am extremely excited to be engaging with DBC's culture. I think that applying to DBC was a scary step in the first place because I was switching career paths and was not even sure if I would ever be passionate about web development. But I am looking forward to it all: facing all sorts coding AND emotional challenges. I believe in having a growth mindset and that it is better to fail at something than to never try. I am excited to not only grow technically and culturally, but also to creat a habit of making a mess in the kitchen and not hesitating when I am curious or need help. I think DBC makes it clear that this is an experience you make for yourself, and I am willing to submerge myself and give it my all.

        <b>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        My expectations of DBC have changed in that DBC offers so much more than I expected! I knew that DBC has a unique culture and creates an integrated learning experience for anyone to learn programming and eventually be able to create meaningful things. From week 0 and week 1, I have learned that DBC goes beyond what it promises. DBC instructors and guides make so much effort to create the best working environment possible. DBC offers all kinds of tips on coding, styles of learning, and on building EQ and I am glad to be a part of it.

        <b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am very excited to participate in DBC's learning environment. DBC's curriculum is intense, challenging, and enriching, and this is exactly what I am looking for. I am a little nervous because I am a beginner programmer, but I am happy to be a part of this program and can't wait to to learn more!
