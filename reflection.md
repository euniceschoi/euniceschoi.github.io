1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that it is really important to understand the distinction among padding, border, and margin. If a text was added in a div, with the div having dimensions, then the padding includes the space right outside the content. Adding styling to the border will show that the border for text is sort of like the text-box line. The margin is the area outside the border and centering it would place the text in the center of the div box. I learned to use margins most commonly when laying out all the frames of my site. Padding was the most useful when I wanted to increase space around a text or image. For styling, I experimented with the border the most.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that CSS positioning can be very frustrating! Time flies by when you're just trying to figure out the positioning of an element. I learned that it never really is a good idea to set the position as absolute, unless it is an element within a relatively positioned div or section. For instance, if you want an image to be absolutely placed in the center of a side bar, then it will always be in the center of the side bar no matter where the side bar is. However, you would not want to set the position of the side bar as absolute since it would move around depending on what screen size you are viewing by, leading to an unstable layout. Static positioning is the default position while fixed position means that the element will be fixed at the same spot no matter how far you scroll around.


3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The aspects that were easiest to implement were the blog posts, since they were mainly composed of text. I simply had to add a background using a div and align the text to my desire. It was also simple to add a banner and center the margins. The most difficult aspect was positioning everything and adjusting them to fit together. I also had a really hard time with overlaying elements.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned several techniques that I will utilize from now on. Such as using overflow for trying to fit images into a container and customizing links via a:hover and a:visited. I also learned that it is important to try things step-by-step when you are stuck and to utilize chrome dev tools. Blocking out codes using (command + "/") was very useful too.
